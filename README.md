## Hi there 
Just an average researcher who enjoys learning about systems and ways to exploit them.

More about me 🤔:
- I'm currently working on creating a custom shellcode encoder / decoder.
- I'm currently learning AI/ML engineering 🌐.
- I love anime, manga, and coffee ☕. 
- Fun Fact: Mikasa caused the rumbling...
